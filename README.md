Live site: http://codepen.io/jugglnaut/full/zoqpKp/

Project Requirements:

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you
need. Give it your own personal style.


User Stories:
- User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

- User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

- User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I
  hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
